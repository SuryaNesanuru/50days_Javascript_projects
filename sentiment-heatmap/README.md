Sentiment Heatmap â€” Demo

This demo produces a simulated text stream and maps a simple rule-based sentiment score to colors in a grid heatmap.

How to run:
- Open `index.html` in your browser.
- Click Start to begin the simulated stream.

Notes:
- This is a client-only demo. For real data, send server-side stream via WebSocket or SSE and replace the random generator in `script.js`.
