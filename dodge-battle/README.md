Dodge Battle â€” Starter

Single-player demo included. To run multiplayer locally you'll need Node.js and the WebSocket server provided in `server.js`.

To run server (optional):
1. cd to this folder
2. npm install
3. node server.js

Notes:
- Server is a minimal relay and starter help for implementing multiplayer. Client-side multiplayer code is left as an exercise.
