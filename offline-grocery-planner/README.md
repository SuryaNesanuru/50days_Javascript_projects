Offline Grocery Planner

Starter PWA-like grocery list that persists to localStorage (offline friendly).

How to use:
- Open `index.html` in your browser.
- Add items and they persist across reloads.

Notes:
- This starter uses localStorage for simplicity. For production use, swap to IndexedDB and add a service worker for full PWA support.
