Accessibility Playground

Contains small interactive widgets (modal, tabs) demonstrating keyboard-first behavior and ARIA usage.

Open `index.html` and try:
- Tab navigation only
- Open modal and verify focus trapping
- Toggle "Show focus outline" to reveal outlines

Stretch:
- Integrate axe-core for automated checks
- Add more widget examples (dropdowns, listboxes)
